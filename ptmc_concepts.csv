1, invariant plane strain,Invariant plane strain is a concept in mechanics, particularly in the field of solid mechanics and materials science, where deformation is restricted to occur only within a specific plane of a material, and this deformation is assumed to be invariant or constant throughout the material thickness.,Simplifies problems of materials behavior,
